# About This Dashboard

This dashboard is designed to support the decision-making process of the installation of heat pumps.
It leverages historical weather information and forecast information to provide a comprehensive analysis of weather patterns in your selected location.
Through interactive and well-formatted plots and tables, you are able to gain immediate insights into historical weather conditions and future predictions,
assisting in assessing the efficiency of installing a heat pump.

## Instructions

1. Use the left sidebar to customize your selection, including location, date range, and measurement units.
2. Temperature Sliders:
    - **Plot Temperature Slider:** Set a temperature value to visually distinguish days below this temperature in the plot:
      days below are marked in grey and above in black, offering a clear view of cooler days.
    - **Table Temperature Slider:** Set a temperature range to show a summary for each temperature within this range,
      including the number of days below each temperature and proportion of the total.
3. Explore rolling average temperature plots by selecting your desired plot options.
4. On the forecast page, choose your trend prediction and specify the forecast year.

**_Please note that accurate predictions require a historical data span of over one year. Make sure to select an appropriate date range for forecasting analysis._**
